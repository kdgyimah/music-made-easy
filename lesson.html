            The following are steps you can take to pursue a career as a musician:
            <br>
            <li><b>Decide what type of musician you want to be.</b> There are various types of musicians, and each type requires a certain set of skills and experience. Knowing which type of musician you want to be will help you better cater to your career path in terms of gaining experience, knowledge and expertise.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Pick an instrument.</b> If you want to be the type of musician that plays musical instruments, you'll need to select an instrument to learn and practice. If you're unsure of what instrument you want to play, start with a more basic instrument such as the guitar or piano. Consider the type of music you want to play when choosing an instrument. For example, if you want to play jazz, you should select an instrument that is commonly used in this type of music. If you want to create music, choose an instrument that is easily compatible with a variety of music such as the guitar.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Take music lessons. </b>A great way to begin a career as a musician is to start taking music lessons. It can be hard to learn a new skill on your own, so a music teacher will be able to guide you as you learn the fundamentals of playing and creating music.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Practice on a regular basis. </b>One of the most important components of a career as a musician is regular practice. Even if you possess a natural talent for music, you should still practice singing or playing instruments regularly. Practice for at least 45 minutes each day and switch up the techniques and type of music you use when practicing.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Join a band. </b>Once you are comfortable with a particular instrument or singing, consider joining a band that's already established. This will provide you with experience and training that will support your career as a musician. Joining a band or another musical group is also a great way to make connections in the music industry.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Record your music.</b> Recording your music is important for several reasons. First, it can help you hear yourself play and allow you to identify any areas of improvement you should work on. Recording music is also necessary if you want to share your music with others, such as with a record label.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Don't give up. </b>A career as a musician is much different from a career in other industries like finance or technology. It can take time to build yourself up as a musician and get noticed by others.
